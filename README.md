## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run the app

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

When the app first loads it requests persistent storage using `navigator.storage.persist()`. Use the **Export Backup**, **Import Backup**, and **Verify Backup** buttons in the UI to manage encrypted backups of your data.

### Install as a PWA

- Open the app in Safari on iOS or any modern browser.
- Tap the share button and choose **Add to Home Screen** to install.

### Export/Import via iCloud Drive

- Choose **Export Backup** to download `retirement.enc` and save it to iCloud Drive.
- To restore, pick the file with **Import Backup** and enter your passphrase.
- **Verify Backup** decrypts the file in memory without altering existing data.

### Security

Backups are endâ€‘toâ€‘end encrypted. The passphrase is never stored; if it is lost the data cannot be recovered.
